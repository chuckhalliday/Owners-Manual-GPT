      "\n",
      "1. Make sure the engine is completely shut off and cooled down.\n",
      "2. Locate the coolant reservoir tank on the outside of the vehicle while the engine is cool.\n",
      "3. Check the coolant level on the reservoir tank. If it is close to or lower than the \"LOW\" level mark, add coolant up to the \"FULL\" level mark. If the reservoir tank is empty, remove the radiator cap and refill coolant up to just below the filler neck.\n",
      "4. After refilling the reserve tank and the radiator, reinstall the cap and check that the rubber gaskets inside the radiator cap are in the proper position.\n",
      "5. Be careful not to spill engine coolant when adding it. If coolant touches the exhaust pipe, it may cause a bad smell, smoke, and/or a fire. If engine coolant gets on the exhaust pipe, be sure to wipe it off.\n",
      "6. If the coolant level in the reserve tank is below the \"LOW\" mark, add coolant up to the \"FULL\" mark after the engine has fully cooled down.\n",
      "7. It is recommended to have the coolant changed by your SUBARU dealer if necessary. Refer to the maintenance schedule in the \"Warranty and Maintenance Booklet\" for the coolant change interval.\n",
      "8. Do not mix SUBARU Super Coolant with any other brand or type of coolant. If it is necessary to add coolant, use only SUBARU Super Coolant.\n",
